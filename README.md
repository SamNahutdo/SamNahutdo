Welcome to my GitHub profile! This README is a short story of my journey in tech—from my early days experimenting with HTML and CSS, to exploring full web development, networking, and simple IoT projects, and finally growing even more through my college experience. I’m passionate about learning, building, and continuously improving my skills.

## 🚀 About Me

I started my journey in technology back in **Junior High School (JHS)** under the **CCS track**, where I was first introduced to the fundamentals of **HTML structures and CSS styling**. During this time, I focused heavily on understanding how web pages are built from the ground up—learning how elements are structured, styled, and organized to create clean and visually appealing layouts. This early exposure helped me develop a strong foundation in front-end basics and sparked my interest in web development.

As I progressed to **Senior High School (SHS)**, my learning expanded significantly. I gained hands-on experience in **web development**, **networking**, and **simple IoT projects**, allowing me to understand not only how applications look, but also how systems communicate and work behind the scenes. During SHS, I learned and used:

* **HTML** – for structuring web pages
* **CSS** – for responsive layouts and visual design
* **JavaScript** – for interactivity and dynamic behavior
* **PHP** – for server-side logic
* **XAMPP** – for local development environments
* **MySQL** – for database management and basic CRUD operations

Through school projects and practice, I learned how to connect front-end interfaces to back-end systems, manage data, and deploy simple full-stack applications locally.

## 🎓 College Journey & Continuous Growth

Now that I am in **college**, my knowledge and experience have grown even further. College has exposed me to deeper concepts, better practices, and more complex problem-solving scenarios. I’ve learned how to think more critically about software design, scalability, and real-world use cases.

During my college journey, I have learned and continuously improved my skills in multiple programming languages, tools, and technologies. I am not only learning *how* to code, but also *why* things work the way they do—from logic and algorithms to system flow and architecture.

I actively work on projects, experiments, and personal practice to sharpen my skills and apply what I’ve learned in real and practical ways.

## 📈 Goals & Motivation

I am continuously motivated to learn new technologies, improve my coding standards, and build projects that solve real problems. My goal is to grow into a skilled and reliable developer who can contribute to meaningful software and systems.

I believe that learning never stops—and every project, bug, and challenge is an opportunity to improve.
